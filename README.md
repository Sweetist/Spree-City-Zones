SpreeCityZones
==============

Ability to have cities defined for states and then used for zones.  The city tax rate will override a state tax rate if defined.


Example
=======

If you define a California tax rate of .0825 and another city tax rate for Hollywood of .0925....

	State-CA, City- Hollywood, rate would be .0925
	State-CA, City- Irvine, rate would be .0825
